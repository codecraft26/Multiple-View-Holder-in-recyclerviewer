# mutiple view holder in one  recycler view

In the imperative programming paradigm in Android, a RecyclerView is a widget used to display scrollable items. Normally, developers use a single type of item to populate data in the RecyclerView.

Have you ever asked yourself how you can employ different types of data items in the same RecyclerView while maintaining a seamless experience?

This is where multiple ViewHolders come in. They allow us to pass different data objects during the RecyclerView callbacks. This way we can create more interactive and scalable applications.## Screen grab
